in these days I work in try to make the app work in the background

Goal : To Fetch the notifications when the app is closed

Def : in mobile app I have 3 status for the app
                                                1) Foreground
                                                2) Background
                                                3) Terminated

in first and the second status the socket IO work correctly and the notification can handle it and payload to handle the navigator of the notification "Route"
in the terminated status cant the socket work direct, so I need to make the socket still working if the app closed

Problem : try to use work_manager package and flutter_background_service to handle this case and cant to do it

my next vision to solve this case to use FCM

why to use it : bc it handle the notification inh the terminated directly but in using socket IO cant do it

another sol : to use native code using channels or use isolate code to make the code work in the background
